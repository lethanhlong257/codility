Write a function:

int solution(int A[], int N);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum among all integers which are multiples of 11.

For example, given array A as follows:

[-6, -91, 1011, -100, 84, -22, 0, 1, 473]

the function should return −22.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..1,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−10,000..10,000];
there is at least one element in array A which satisfies the condition in the task statement.
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
